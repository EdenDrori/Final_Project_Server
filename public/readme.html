      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The Vintage Shop project is a web application that serves as an online
        marketplace for vintage items. Users can register as either sellers or
        buyers, with distinct functionalities tailored to each role. Sellers can
        publish items for sale, manage their listings, and track sales. Buyers
        can browse items, add them to favorites, and make purchases securely
        using valid credit card information.
